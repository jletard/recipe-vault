Recipe Vault 🥘🔧

The Unseen Chef Archive
(Personal Edition — Project Concluded)

A mobile-first web application for browsing, managing, and safeguarding recipes —
dark, tactical, and elegant like Gotham itself.
📋 Project Overview

Recipe Vault is a Next.js app (built with TypeScript and TailwindCSS) that connects securely to an Airtable database to manage recipes.

Designed with a mobile-first Gotham philosophy —
sleek on large screens, but always combat-ready for mobile.

Each recipe card features:

    🔧 Recipe name (dark-mode styling)

    🔧 Expand/Collapse control (no accidental clicks)

    🔧 Dynamic, color-coded tag badges

    🔧 Ingredients formatted as a bulleted list

    🔧 Procedure steps numbered cleanly

    🔧 Optional notes section

🚀 Project Status: Concluded

✅ Gotham Milestone Achieved:
Recipe Vault has reached full operational capability as a private archive.

✅ Final Deployment:

    Fully live and functional for personal use

    Seamless mobile-first experience

    Airtable-driven backend secured via server-side API routes

✅ No further development planned on this edition.
The Vault stands complete — a fortress for recipes, crafted in darkness and elegance.

➡️ The multi-user successor project is now underway: Recipe Forge — Recipes Crafted, Shared, and Managed.
🔥 Data Fetch Strategy (Locked In)

For maximum security and elegance:

    No Airtable API exposure to the browser

    All interactions via Next.js internal API routes:

        /api/recipes

        /api/add-recipe

        /api/edit-recipe

        /api/delete-recipe

    Server Routes:

        Read Airtable credentials securely from .env.local

        Map Airtable fields into clean, strongly-typed Recipe objects

    Client (page.tsx) fetches pre-sanitized data safely

✅ Airtable API token stays hidden — always.
✅ All Airtable interactions are server-controlled and bat-proof.
🛃️ Legacy TODO List (For Historical Reference)

📄 Technical Strengths

Full strict TypeScript coverage — no any left in Gotham

Airtable field names strongly typed and protected

Modular folder structure (/app, /components, /hooks, /lib, /types, /utils)

Mobile-first philosophy — responsive across all devices, including Samsung Fold, iPhones, and Batphones

🔧 Unified Tag System:
Centralized TagPill component managing all badge displays and states.

🏆 Notes on the Final Triumph (April 30, 2025)

Today, Gotham grew even stronger:

    Full Edit Recipe functionality implemented

    Pagination system added with Display Count control

    Gotham-style Card layout standardized across pages

    Page.tsx refactored into a true Batcave control center

    Minor UI skews eliminated (no Smallville issues left)

    Full CRUD cycle (Add/Edit/Delete) confirmed clean and robust

✅ True professional-grade engineering
✅ Zero hidden bugs
✅ Platform fully battle-hardened

🔧
Built for speed.
Built for stealth.
Built for victory.

This is — and will always be — the Recipe Vault.
🔥 Final Notes:

    "The Vault stands sealed.
    The Forge begins."
