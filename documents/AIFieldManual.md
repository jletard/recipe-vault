## ðŸ“‚ Key Project Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `/src/app/page.tsx` | Primary homepage UI â€” handles browsing, searching, filtering, pagination, modal control |
| `/src/components/` | Modular UI elements (Buttons, Modals, RecipeCard, etc.) |
| `/src/hooks/` | Reusable logic (e.g., `useTagFilter`, `useAddRecipe`) |
| `/src/lib/` | External service connections (e.g., Airtable API handler) |
| `/src/types/` | TypeScript interfaces and types |
| `/src/utils/` | Helper functions (e.g., `tagColors.ts`) |
| `/documents/` | Internal planning documents |

## ðŸ“œ Rules of Engagement (ChatGPT Behavior Expectations)

1. **No assumptions without confirmation.**
2. **Never use `any` type.**  
   Always strict TypeScript typing.
3. **Comment headers at top of every code file.**  
   (Filename and purpose.)
4. **No spaghetti code.**  
   Modular, clean, small logical components.
5. **Only one modal open at any time.**  
   No stacked modals.
6. **Client-side pagination only.**  
   Full recipe set is always fetched at once.
7. **Tag colors are dynamic.**  
   They can change â€” no permanent color locks.
8. **Vaults are private unless explicitly shared.**
9. **Kitchen hierarchy is sacred:**  
   Chefs control Kitchens; Cooks suggest but do not command.

## âš¡ Session Protocol Reminders

- **Ask permission before generating big changes.**

ðŸ”§ **The AIFieldManual ensures the Recipe Vault project remains dark, minimalistic, tactical, and under full user control.**
