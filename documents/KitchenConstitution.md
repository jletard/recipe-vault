## 🏛 Kitchen Core Rules

### 1. **Kitchen Creation and Ownership**

- Kitchens are created by a user who becomes the **Chef**.
- A Kitchen has only **one Chef** at any time.
- The Chef holds sovereign authority over Kitchen operations.

### 2. **Invitations and Joining**

- Only Chefs may invite users (Cooks) into their Kitchen.
- Invitations must be **manually accepted** by users.
- Declined or ignored invitations result in no membership.

### 3. **Vault and Recipe Privacy**

- Being in a Kitchen does **not** expose a user’s personal Vault.
- Vault recipes remain private unless explicitly shared.
- Sharing a recipe into a Kitchen creates a **live link** — updates to the original recipe propagate into the Kitchen.

### 4. **Recipe Sharing and Notes**

- Chefs can directly share any of their Vault recipes into the Kitchen.
- Cooks can propose recipes to the Chef (send for approval).
- All shared recipes are live-linked but notes are **Kitchen-local**.
- Cooks may add notes to any shared recipe.
- Notes are visible to all Kitchen members.
- Chefs can review and delete notes as necessary.

### 5. **Firing and Departure**

- Chefs can fire Cooks at any time.
- When a Cook is fired:
  - Immediate loss of Kitchen access.
  - Cannot see shared recipes anymore.
  - **Previously made notes remain visible** unless deleted by the Chef.
  - Any recipes the Cook copied into their own Vault remain in their possession.
  - Any pending invitations by the Chef are revoked.

### 6. **Kitchen Privacy and Future Expansion**

- Kitchens are private-only by default.
- No public Kitchens exist in the current system.
- A potential public option remains open for future expansion if demanded by users.
