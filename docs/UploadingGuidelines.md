🗂️ Uploading Guidelines for Recipe Vault

Last Updated: 2024-04-29
📋 General Philosophy

All recipes must be entered in a clean, consistent format to ensure perfect display inside the Recipe Vault app.
Formatting consistency is mandatory to avoid future bugs, ugly displays, or extra work.
🥄 Field-by-Field Instructions
Field	Rule
Recipe Name	One line, short and clear. Capitalize properly.
Description	Full sentences. No special formatting needed. Plain text.
Ingredients	One ingredient per line.
No semicolons, no commas for separation.
✅ Example:
2 cups flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
Instructions	One step per line. No manual numbering.
✅ Example:
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Mix dry ingredients together.
Add wet ingredients.
(The app will auto-number.)
Notes	Full sentences. Optional. Use natural paragraph text.
Tags	Select from existing tags whenever possible.
New tags are allowed, but keep them clean and lowercase if appropriate (e.g., "vegan", "dessert").
🛑 Things to Never Do

    ❌ No manual numbering in Instructions (the app will number for you).

    ❌ No semicolons in Ingredients.

    ❌ No multiple steps in a single Instruction line.

    ❌ No giant paragraphs inside Ingredients or Instructions.
